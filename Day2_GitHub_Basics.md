# Learning Git & GitHub Basics

# What I Learned Today
- The difference between **Git** (version control system) and **GitHub** (a platform for hosting code).  
- How **commits** represent small, trackable updates to a project.  
- How to write **clear commit messages** that explain your work.  
- Basic Git commands:
  - `git init` → start a new local repository  
  - `git add .` → stage changes  
  - `git commit -m "message"` → save a version  
  - `git push` → upload to GitHub  

# Task
Created my first learning log to document Git & GitHub fundamentals for my GSoC journey.
